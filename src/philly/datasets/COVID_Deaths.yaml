notes: "***COVID datasets are now a snapshot in time from 2020 - December 2024. ***\r\
  \n\r\n**For greatest accuracy, please use the latest dataset for all analysis and\
  \ reporting as opposed to any data you downloaded prior to September 29, 2020. All\
  \ datasets now reflect counts from test collection dates instead of the previously\
  \ displayed result dates.  These changes will adjust, for example, the count of\
  \ cases for each day. PDPH has also added 376 confirmed COVID-19 cases (positive\
  \ tests) that were previously missing from the data.**\r\n\r\nDeidentified, aggregate\
  \ datasets showing COVID deaths by date, zip, race, or age. You can [find COVID\
  \ cases datasets here](https://www.opendataphilly.org/datasets/covid-cases). To\
  \ protect the confidentiality of residents, PDPH suppresses the exact data for any\
  \ categories that have less than 6 counts (i.e. of cases or fatalities)."
